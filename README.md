# Piko-the-Kobold
Fan-Made model that recreates @SimplifyAM's OC, Piko the Kobold, as a minecraft character.
It's worth to mention that I took inspiration from @Myahster's posts on Twitter.

# Note
Before creating this model I didn't know anything about scripting so it was quite a challenge to get everything I had planned to work, but after a lot of struggle I managed to finish it.
This model has been available since July 15, 2023 on the new FiguraMC discord server.
Every comment is appreciated
