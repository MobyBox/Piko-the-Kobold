# Piko-the-Kobold
Fan-Made model that recreates @SimplifyAM's OC, Piko the Kobold, as a minecraft character.
It's worth to mention that I took inspiration from @Myahster's posts on Twitter.

# Disclaimer
Before creating this model I didn't know anything about scripting so it was quite a challenge to get everything I had planned to work, but after a lot of struggle I managed to finish it.

# Features
* You got two horns
* A moving tail depending if you're walking, sprinting or sneaking.
* A slightly moving loincloth.
